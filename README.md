# VGTrivia
*A game about games.*

# Context

During Apple Foundation Program Advanced, I made this small trivia game entirely on my own, as a side project, on my spare time.

The primary goal was to get a basic trivia engine running. I made it about video games, because I needed a theme, so why not?

# Details

## Features
- **30 questions**: the game ships with a pool of 30 hand-written questions.
- **Round length**: pick a set number of questions from 5 to 30 and get to play!
- **Randomization**: the game picks questions at random from a pool of 30 questions. The answers' order is also randomized, unless otherwise noted in the question.
- **Score**: the game keeps track of your score and gives you an evaluation on the result screen at the end of the round.
- **Explanations**: every question comes with a bit of trivia about the answer, no matter if you were right or wrong.
- **Dark mode**: iOS light and dark modes are equally supported.
- **Easter egg**: you'll have to find out by yourself!

*Some previews screenshots can be found [at the end of this README](#screenshots).*

## Who did it?

This was a solo project. I did everything entirely on my own from ideation to deployment.
I focused on testing my knowledge in:
- Swift / SwiftUI
- Local data structures and MVVM
- Code legibility and reusability
- Visual design and animations
- UX/UI in a game context

I used Xcode as the IDE, and Figma as a preliminary tool for visual design research.

## When?

The v1.0 of the project was done on my spare time, in August 2025.
- Preliminary design works and coming up with the questions (~one week)
- Coding and deployment (~two weeks).

## What's next?

I'd love to keep improving on this small game to make it better.

Here are a few ideas of features I'd like to implement later:
- **Difficulty rating**: let players pick only easy/medium/hard mode questions.
- **Categories**: let players filter questions by one or several categories.
- **New game modes**: timed rounds, pick next question from its title, etc.
- **Multimedia era**: allow questions and their explanations to show an image or to play a sound.
- **More questions**: ...well, more questions!
- and more (save best scores, collectibles...).
